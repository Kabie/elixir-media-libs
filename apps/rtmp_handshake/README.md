# RtmpHandshake

This library can be used to facilitate handshake with RTMP servers and clients.  It fully supports both the simple handshake process specified in the (RTMP Specification)[http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/rtmp/pdf/rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf] and the flash 9/10 digest handshake based on (the following unofficial specification)[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/RTMPE.txt].
